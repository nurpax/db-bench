Haskell database benchmark
==========================

A simple benchmark for comparing Haskell *-simple database binding
libraries
(e.g. [sqlite-simple](https://github.com/nurpax/sqlite-simple/)) to
native C sqlite and Python sqlite.  For the purpose of this benchmark,
the C implementation of the same benchmark is considered the fastest
possible, which gives us a good comparison point for Haskell
performance tuning.
