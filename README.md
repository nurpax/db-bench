Haskell database benchmark
==========================

A simple benchmark for comparing Haskell
[sqlite-simple](https://github.com/nurpax/snaplet-sqlite-simple/)
performance to native C sqlite access.  For the purpose of this
benchmark, the C implementation of the same benchmark is considered the
fastest possible, which gives us a good comparison point for Haskell
performance tuning.
